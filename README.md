# Storage Backend
The Storage Backend module integrates with various storage solutions to efficiently manage file storage within Odoo. Specifically, the Storage Backend S3 integration allows files to be stored on Amazon S3, a popular cloud storage solution, while maintaining seamless interaction with Odooâ€™s internal storage mechanisms. This integration provides users with flexibility in managing file storage locally or remotely and enhances the scalability of file storage for large datasets.

## Feature and functionality
| **Feature** | **Description**  |
| ------- | --- |
| **Storage Backend Configuration** | The module enables configuration of multiple storage backends, including the Amazon S3 backend. By defining storage strategies, administrators can choose to store files locally within Odoo or offload them to external systems like S3 for scalable and reliable file storage.|
| **Amazon S3 Storage Support** | The StorageBackendS3 integration provides full support for storing files on Amazon S3. Files are uploaded to S3 buckets defined by the administrator, and their URLs are generated for access. The integration supports public and private file settings, enabling secure access control. |
| **Dynamic Backend Switching** | Files can be configured to switch between different storage backends based on system settings. If configured for S3, the files are uploaded to the specified S3 bucket; otherwise, they are stored locally in the Odoo system. This dynamic switching feature allows flexibility in storage management and reduces operational complexity.|
| **Seamless File Management** | With the integration of Storage Backend S3, files managed by Odoo are handled seamlessly, whether stored locally or remotely. The storage system automatically handles URL generation for both local and remote files, ensuring consistent access methods across different backends. |
| **File Metadata Management** | Metadata for each file stored is retained, including SHA1 checksum, file size, MIME type, and file location (whether it's stored locally or on S3). This metadata ensures that files can be efficiently managed, accessed, and validated, regardless of where they are stored. |
